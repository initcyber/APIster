# APIster - Introduction
This python program (currently being developed) will be utilized to "scrape" a website or IP Address to determine what API endpoints exists and what information can be obtained from the API endpoint. This is a very simple tool that will test all open ports for an open API endpoint, assuming that the API endpoint uses "API" in the url.

## Notes/To-Do
In order for this project to function better (pentesting purposes so to speak, with PERMISSION obviously), it would probably be best to incorporate a proxy (mitmproxy?) in order to "mask" your IP Address so it doesn't get blocked by any sort of IDS/IPS which may be implemented.

- Incorporate a proxy
- (Possibly) find a common list of "API" endpoints (such as "http://yourdomain.com/xyz" where "xyz" is another common API endpoint)
- Refactor Code
- Implement a web front end (Django)
- Dockerize
- Export list obtained from port_scanner.py and api_scanner.py into a csv for further investigation.
